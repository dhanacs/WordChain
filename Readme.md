# Code Kata Problem 19 Solution

This folder contains the solution to Code Kata problem 19, which involves solving a problem related to dictionaries and anagrams. In this solution, we assume that all dictionary words are of the same length, denoted as 'w.' However, it's worth noting that this solution can be extended to handle arbitrary-length dictionary words.

## Other Approach
Strings can be "hashed" without using "tries". Adjacency matrix can then be constructed.
